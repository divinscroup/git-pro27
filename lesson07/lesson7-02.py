# Read through the code below. Even if you don't understand it, try to make

#we defind a function that recall 'hello' value
def say_hello():
    return "Hello!"

print say_hello()

# say_hello is a function. Or, as Dave would call it, a procedure.
# This procedure isn't particularly interesting because it only does
# one thing.
